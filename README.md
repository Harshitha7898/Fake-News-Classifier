# Fake-News-Classifier
ðŸ“„ Fake News Headline Classifier ðŸ“°
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify news headlines as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and classification algorithms to detect misleading news content.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Logistic Regression model for classification

Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

ðŸš€ Technologies Used:
Python

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

ðŸ“Œ Project Outcome:
The classifier predicts whether a given news headline is genuine or fake, helping to combat the spread of misinformation.
